# obsidian-taskr

Warning: This is still very much a prototype, use at your own risk.

Another task manager for Obsidian, featuring the following:
- App-like UI's for Tasks
- Dedicated Note for each task
- Ease of capture through NLP techniques
- Estimate how long each task will take with "Effort"

Roadmap
- [ ] More 'view' options (backlog, this week, today, overdue, completed, person view, project view, etc.)

- [ ] Better names for task notes
- [ ] More options for taskr code block
- [ ] Instructions / documentation
- [ ] Move out of prototype
- [ ] Habits?
